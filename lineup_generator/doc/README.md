## How Lineup Generator works



Lineup Generator goal is to choose a subset of nine players in order to respect some constraints and guarantee the best combination according with some criteria.

###Install dependencies
Lineup generator depends on

1. [Google Optimization Tools (or-tools)][ortools]: Google software suite for combinatorial optimization, that provides a C++ API to implement and solve mathematical models through [CBC][cbc]. This code uses the [binary distribution][ubuntu] for Ubuntu 14.04.
2. [libpqxx4-0][pqxx]: the official C++ client API for â€‹PostgreSQL. It can be installed through apt-get. You need both libpqxx-4.0 and libpqxx-dev installed.
3. [PostgreSQL][postgresql]: database (version 9.4). For instructions on how to install in linux mint through apt-get see [Installing and Configuring Postgresql on Linux Mint][mint].
4. GCC compiler version 4.9.

In order to compile and run Lineup Generator successfully, make sure you have all the tools above installed.

### Create database

You can find into the `database` directory a .sql file to create database and its tables, and also a simple program to populate it from a .json file. The executable file can be generated by running `make` from the database directory. If everything goes fine then you can run:
```
$ ./populate_db
```
###Download and compile
We assume you have a directory with or-tools already installed and working.

1. After you have installed and tested all dependencies, download and copy this inner `lineup_generator` directory and `Makefile.user` file in the top level of your or-tools directory.
2. Run the following command from the top level of or-tools directory:

	``` $ make ccc EX=lineup_generator/src/lineup_generator.cc```

3. You should have a `bin/lineup_generator` binary if compilation is successfully. Finally run lineup generator and if you get an error of missing arguments everything is working.

	```$ ./bin/lineup_generator```

### Run
The command to run the tool is:
```
./bin/lineup_generator [-num_lineups n] -dbname <db_name> -user <db_user> -password <db_password> [-host db_address] [-port db_port]
```
If no *n* for *-num_lineups* is given, then just one lineup is provided.
